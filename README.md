**System Health Monitoring Script**

This Bash script is designed to monitor and display system health information, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space. It runs in a loop, refreshing every 5 seconds, and outputs the results to a text file.

**Usage**

1. Make sure you have Bash installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the script to your local machine.

**Steps**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/system-health-script.git
3.	Navigate to the script directory.

cd system-health-script
4.	Make the script executable.

chmod +x health_monitor.sh
5.	Run the script.

./health_monitor.sh
The script will display real-time system health information in the terminal and save the results to a file named health_results.txt.

**Customization**
You can customize the script to suit your needs. For example, you might want to adjust the refresh interval, add more monitoring functions, or modify the output format.
